# Planning: open issues and future work

This directory holds what the library does **not** yet do or has not yet
settled: defects, unverified results, review items, solver plans,
proposals, parked ideas and future extensions. It is kept separate from
the reference documentation in `doc/`, which describes only what the
library does and why.

Rules of the directory:

- Each item is one section with a short title, a **Status** line
  (open / proposal / parked / decided, and what is decided), a
  self-contained description with the mathematics, measurements and
  arguments that matter, and a **See** line pointing to the reference
  document (by section name) and to the code.
- Measurements are quoted with their settings (model, mesh size `h`,
  order, solver options) so that they can be rerun.
- When an item is resolved it is removed from here, and the reference
  documents in `doc/` are updated to describe the outcome. A decision
  that leaves nothing to do is recorded in the reference docs, not here;
  a decision is kept here only while some part of the item remains open.
