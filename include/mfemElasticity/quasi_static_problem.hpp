/**
 * @file quasi_static_problem.hpp
 * @brief Linear quasi-static problems: the abstract interface used by the
 * viscoelastic layer, a base class owning the shared bookkeeping (serial and
 * parallel), and two reference problems (pure traction, clamped).
 *
 * A problem is the equilibrium of a body at a time @f$t@f$: geometry,
 * boundary conditions, loads and solver. Whether the body is elastic or
 * viscoelastic is decided by its Rheology; the problem assembles the
 * rheology's (effective) elastic stiffness and never sees the internal
 * variables, which the viscoelastic layer evolves around it.
 *
 * **Naming convention for problem classes.** Names are built from fixed
 * axis slots, left to right:
 * @verbatim
 *   [Linear|Nonlinear] [QuasiStatic|Dynamic]
 *     [Mixed|Referential]? [SelfGravitating]? [variant] Problem
 * @endverbatim
 * - Linearity and time regime always appear (Static needs no slot of its
 *   own: it is QuasiStatic at fixed data).
 * - The elasticity is *referential in every class*; the formulation slot
 *   says how the *gravity* is described, so it exists only for
 *   self-gravitating problems: `Mixed` = referential displacement with
 *   the spatial (Eulerian) potential perturbation (the Dahlen-style
 *   organisation, mixed_problem.hpp); `Referential` = fully referential,
 *   including the potential (referential_problem.hpp). Without gravity
 *   there is nothing to mix and the slot is omitted: the classes in this
 *   file are referential, trivially so when the body is unstressed.
 * - Properties of the *reference state* — hydrostatic vs non-hydrostatic
 *   equilibrium stress, and natural vs non-natural particle labels in the
 *   sense of Al-Attar & Crawford 2016 (natural: the label *is* the
 *   equilibrium position, @f$\varphi_e = \mathrm{id}@f$) — are carried by
 *   the Rheology, not by class names; a class that *requires* a special
 *   reference state (the mixed formulation requires hydrostatic +
 *   natural) says so in its documentation.
 * - The variant tail names a boundary-condition or interface
 *   specialisation (`Traction`, `Clamped`, `Slip`), and a derived class
 *   extends its parent's name rightward.

/**
 * @brief Abstract interface for linear quasi-static problems.
 *
 * Per evaluation time @f$t@f$ the protocol is
 * @code
 *   AssembleForce(t);        // all time-dependent data to t; external loads;
 *                            // increments cleared
 *   AddForce(f); ...         // superpose dual vectors on the displacement
 *   Solve();                 // displacement <- K^{-1}(external + increments)
 * @endcode
 *
 * - AssembleForce(t) is called at every stage of a time integrator, with
 *   possibly non-monotone t; it must be cheap and idempotent at fixed t.
 * - AddForce(f) takes the vdof (L-vector) layout of DisplacementSpace(),
 *   i.e. the layout of a LinearForm on that space before FormLinearSystem.
 *   In parallel the problem applies the prolongation transpose inside
 *   Solve(); callers never handle true dofs. AddForce accumulates.
 * - Solve() may be internally iterative or nonlinear, but is a black box to
 *   callers; linearity in the *forces* is part of the contract. It returns
 *   false if the linear solver did not converge.
 * - Problems carrying more unknowns than the displacement (a gravitational
 *   potential, say) keep them internal: the interface only ever refers to
 *   the displacement. There is one displacement field; several solid
 *   regions share it on a (possibly disconnected) SubMesh, and regional
 *   material differences are the rheology's business.
 *
 * Implicit and exponential-trapezoid viscoelastic stepping eliminate the
 * internal variables and need the stiffness reassembled with the
 * *effective* modulus @f$C_\infty + \sum_k \beta_k C_k@f$, with pointwise
 * relaxation weights @f$\beta_k@f$ (see ElasticStiffness); problems that
 * can do so advertise it through SupportsRelaxationWeights().
