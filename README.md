# mfemElasticity

This library contains extensions to the mfem library associated with the solution of elastic and viscoelastic problems. The particular focus is on geophysical applications.
The methods are under active development, and in the longer term it is hoped that some of this functionality might be usefully incorporated into the main mfem library.
