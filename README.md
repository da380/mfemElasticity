# mfemElasticity

Extensions to the [MFEM library](https://mfem.org) for quasi-static elastic and
viscoelastic problems in geophysics, including self-gravitation, fluid
regions, general (non-hydrostatic, non-natural) reference states and slipping
fluid–solid interfaces. The main pieces, by header in `include/mfemElasticity/`
(`include/mfemElasticity.hpp` includes them all), are

- the component ordering and node/component indexing of vector, matrix and
  symmetric tensor fields (`index.hpp`);
- integrators (`bilininteg.hpp`, `lininteg.hpp`): mixed bilinear/linear form
  integrators between vector, scalar and tensor nodal spaces and the strain
  interpolators; a general (anisotropic) elasticity integrator; the
  initial-stress stiffness split (material and geometric stiffness) and the
  referential gravity terms; the boundary integrators of fluid–solid and
  slipping interfaces; and the transformed diffusion integrator for Poisson
  problems on a reference domain. Most take an optional mapping and then
  assemble the pulled-back form. General-purpose coefficients are in
  `coefficient.hpp`;
- elastic tensor coefficients in the Mandel convention (`elastic_tensor.hpp`):
  isotropic, transversely isotropic (radially anisotropic), Voigt-matrix,
  rotated and deviatoric-projection tensors, the relabelling transformation of
  a tensor, and the conversion of seismological (PREM) moduli to the bare
  tensor of the general theory;
- the exterior Poisson machinery: a matrix-free Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator
  on a spherical outer boundary and multipole operators (`poisson.hpp`), built
  on real orthonormal harmonics on a circle or sphere, with synthesis of
  fields from coefficients and analysis of a finite-element field (scalar, or
  the radial or tangential part of a vector) on any spherical boundary
  (`spherical_harmonics.hpp`), and mesh queries (`mesh.hpp`);
- coupling of forms between a mesh and its `SubMesh`es through a signed dof
  injection, and the dof pairing of sibling SubMeshes (`submesh.hpp`);
- a linear quasi-static problem interface with traction and clamped
  reference implementations and the gauge penalty of gauged fluid regions
  (`quasi_static_problem.hpp`); elastic and generalised Maxwell rheologies,
  isotropic or anisotropic, composite by region, with optional
  state-dependent relaxation (`rheology.hpp`, `relaxation_law.hpp`); and a
  viscoelastic time-dependent operator with explicit, implicit and
  exponential time stepping (`viscoelastic.hpp`);
- the self-gravitating problems, which implement the same interface so the
  viscoelastic layer runs on them unchanged: the mixed (Eulerian-potential)
  problem with Dahlen or gauged fluid regions (`mixed_problem.hpp`), and the
  fully referential problem about a general reference state, with its
  slipping-interface variant (`referential_problem.hpp`);
- background states for the referential problems (`background.hpp`): the
  hydrostatic state of a radial model, its relabelled description, and
  minimum-norm and minimum-deviatoric equilibrium stress fields for
  aspherical bodies;
- the mapping (relabelling) layer (`mappings.hpp`): diffeomorphisms of the
  reference domain (identity, analytic, radial, tapered, grid-function),
  their interpolation, mapped meshes, and pull-back and Nanson coefficients;
- rigid-body and general null-space projectors and projected Krylov solvers
  for singular systems (`null_space.hpp`);
- the manifest that planetmodel writes beside a mesh, read into the
  attribute lists and markers the problems take, with the mesh and the
  fields of the model opened as it says (`mesh_manifest.hpp`).

Serial and parallel (MPI) paths are provided throughout.
`examples/love_numbers.cpp` shows the self-gravitating machinery end to end:
load and tidal Love numbers read off one solve per degree.

## Documentation

The API is documented in the headers (Doxygen; build with `BUILD_DOCS`). The
documents in the source tree are of two kinds.

`doc/planning/`, indexed by its `README.md` (`open_issues.md`, `solvers.md`,
`future_work.md`, `equilibrium_figures.md`).

## Installation

MFEM must be built first (a parallel MFEM, with hypre and METIS, for the MPI
build). The project uses CMake; in-source builds are refused.

**Serial:**
```bash
cmake -S . -B build_serial \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/mfem_serial_build \
      -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build_serial -j
```

**Parallel:**
```bash
cmake -S . -B build_parallel \
      -DUSE_MPI=ON \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/mfem_parallel_build \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/mpic++ \
      -DMPI_C_COMPILER=/path/to/mpicc \
      -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/mpic++ \
      -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build_parallel -j
```

`INSTALL.md` is the reference for the build: it lists every option
(`USE_MPI`, `BUILD_EXAMPLES`, `BUILD_TESTS`, `BUILD_BENCHMARKS`,
`BUILD_DOCS`, `GENERATE_MESHES`, and the Python interpreters used by the
mesh and benchmark scripts) with its default, explains how the MPI launcher
for the tests is chosen, and describes installation.

## Examples

The programs in `examples/` demonstrate the library on small problems, most
of them checked against an exact solution, a closed form or a second
formulation. They are run from the build's `examples/` directory, show
their fields in [GLVis](https://glvis.org) and write their curves as CSV
tables plotted by the `plot_csv.py` script the build puts beside them.
**`examples/README.md`** explains how to run them and look at the results,
and describes each one.

### Meshes

The gmsh meshes the examples and tests read are not in the repository. They
are generated into the build's `data/` directory, at build time, by the
Python scripts in `meshes/`, which use the
[planetmodel](https://pypi.org/project/planetmodel/) package to drive gmsh.
The scripts are short and meant to be copied and changed; `meshes/README.md`
lists them, the files they write and the attribute conventions. Each mesh
file comes with a JSON manifest beside it saying which attribute is which
layer or interface and at what radius. `meshes/aspherical_body.py` shows how
a body gets a non-spherical shape from a formula, with and without a buffer
shell, and any example accepts the result through `-m`.

Generation is on whenever examples or tests are built (`GENERATE_MESHES`,
default follows those two options). It needs a Python 3.12 or later that can
import `planetmodel.mesh3d` (planetmodel 1.2.3 or later) and `mfem.ser`
(PyMFEM, through which the aspherical meshes are written). CMake uses the one
named by `MESHES_PYTHON` if given, otherwise the Python it finds, and if that
does not qualify it creates a virtual environment `meshes-venv` under the
build directory and installs `planetmodel[meshing,mfem]>=1.2.3` into it (about
100 MB, once per build directory). A fresh build spends a few minutes
generating meshes, most of it on the 3-D ones; later builds regenerate a mesh
only when its script changes.
