"""What every mesh script here shares.

Each script in this directory builds one kind of mesh with planetmodel and
writes the `.msh` file, with a JSON manifest beside it saying what every
attribute means. The build runs them (see CMakeLists.txt here) and puts
the meshes in the build tree's `data/` directory, where the C++ examples
and tests read them; nothing is written to the source tree. Run by hand,
a script writes to the current directory unless told otherwise.

The scripts are meant to be read and copied. To make a new mesh, copy the
closest script, change the skeleton, the sizing or the shells, give the
output a new name, and add a line to CMakeLists.txt. Every script takes
`--out DIR`, `--verbose` to let gmsh talk, and `--help`.
