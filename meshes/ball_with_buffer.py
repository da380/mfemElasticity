"""A unit ball with a buffer shell around it: data/coupled_poisson.msh.

The body is the unit ball and the buffer extends to radius 2. The mesh is
deliberately coarse so that the repository stays small; the examples that
use it say so where it matters.

Domain attribute 1 is the body and 2 the buffer. Boundary attribute 1 is
the body's surface and 2 the outer sphere. Order-2 elements.

Used by: coupled_poisson, self_gravitating_elasticity, love_numbers, the tests.
