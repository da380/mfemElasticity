"""A unit disc with a buffer annulus around it: data/elastogravity_2d.msh.

The body is the unit disc. Outside it a shell, or buffer, extends to
radius 1.2; the gravitational potential is solved on the whole domain and
the far-field condition is applied on the buffer's outer circle, while
the elastic problem lives on the body alone.

Domain attribute 1 is the body and 2 the buffer. Boundary attribute 1 is
the body's surface and 2 the outer circle. Order-2 elements.

Used by: self_gravitating_elasticity, love_numbers, the tests.
